                    Making money is a skill that is dependent on a variety of factors. 
                    Unfortunately,<br> a sizable portion of the population is still unaware of 
                    new ways to make money, <br>manage finances, and become wealthy. Furthermore, 
                    many business ideas fail <br>every day, but a select few succeed in today's 
                    business and financial world.

                        <dd>
                            The best selling The Millionaire Next Door identifies seven common traits 
                            that show up again and again among those who have accumulated wealth. 
                            Most of the truly wealthy in this country don't live in Beverly Hills 
                            or on Park Avenue-they live next door. This new edition, the first since 1998, 
                            includes a new foreword for the twenty-first century by Dr. Thomas J. Stanley

                            Rich Dad Poor Dad is Robert's story of growing up with two dads - 
                            his real father and the father of his best friend, his rich dad - 
                            and the ways in which both men shaped his thoughts about money and investing. 
                            The book explodes the myth that you need to earn a high income to be rich 
                            and explains the difference between working for money and having your money work for you.

                            This book will teach you how rich people think. It compares the thoughts, 
                            habits and philosophies of the middle class to the world class when it comes to wealth. 
                            The differences are as extreme as they are numerous. The strategy is simple: learn how rich people think, 
                            copy them, take action and get rich. This book hits hard and never lets up. It's based on a quarter 
                            century of interviews with millionaires.

                            Think and Grow Rich has been called the "Granddaddy of All Motivational Literature." It was the first book to boldly ask, "What makes a winner?" The man who asked and listened for the answer, Napoleon Hill, is now counted in the top ranks of the world's winners himself.
                            The most famous of all teachers of success spent "a fortune and the better part of a lifetime of effort" to produce the "Law of Success" philosophy that forms the basis of his books and that is so powerfully summarized in this one.

                        <dd>
                            More than one hundred years ago, Wallace D. Wattles penned what is without doubt one of the most influential books ever written on the subject of success and prosperity, The Science of Getting Rich. In this landmark 'Original Retro First Edition', every detail of the 1910 first edition has been faithfully reproduced. The precise text, as well as all formatting (capitals, italics, spacing etc.) and embellishments, has been painstakingly recreated here to present the book exactly as Mr Wattles intended. This original work of genius is a practical manual which teaches in simple language how to work precisely with the immutable laws of the universe to create wealth and abundance.

Screw It, Lets Do It reveals the lessons from life that have helped him through his business and personal life  such as, believe it can be done and that, if others disagree with you, try and try again until you achieve your goal; or that you must love what you do.

                        <dd>
                            Since you were old enough to hold a job, you've been hoodwinked to believe that wealth can be created by blindly trusting in the uncontrollable and unpredictable markets: the housing market, the stock market, and the job market. I call this soul-sucking, dream-stealing dogma "The Slowlane" - an impotent financial gamble that dubiously promises wealth in a wheelchair. Accept the Slowlane as your financial roadmap and your financial future will blow carelessly asunder on a sailboat of hope: hope you can get a job and keep it, hope the stock market doesn't tank, hope the economy rebounds, hope, hope, and hope. Do you really want hope to be the centerpiece of your family's financial plan?
